    The 46 AutoCAD hatch patterns included in RVB_PAT.ZIP were
    created by myself in 1988 using a program I co-authored called
    Pattern Maker.  This program is currently available from
    Palisades Research (800) 556-2226 for $99.

    The original instructions were only five pages indicating how
    simple this program is to learn and use. I created my first
    pattern, MOBY, in less than 10 minutes! Enjoy.

    The pattern files are left as separate files for ease of
    identification. The ones you want to use should be appended to
    your acad.pat file.
