INTRODUCTION
------------

Thank you for downloading cshatch.zip

This file contains new hatches for AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT.

The zip file contains:

acad.pat

acad.slb

readme.txt

When installed, this software allows you to use 64 new hatch patterns.
 
These new patterns can be used with the normal hatch commands: HATCH and 
BHATCH.

The new pattern names are: cs1, cs2, cs3...up to...cs64.

-----------------------
USING THE HATCH COMMAND
-----------------------

If using the normal HATCH command, you will not be able to see the new 
patterns displayed as icons from which you can choose. Instead, you must  
enter the pattern name e.g cs47, when prompted.


------------------------
USING THE BHATCH COMMAND
------------------------

When using BHATCH you will be able to see the new hatch patterns displayed as 
icons by clicking the OPTIONS then PATTERN buttons in the BHATCH dialogue box. 
The new patterns will be displayed along with the standard AutoCAD patterns. 

To use a new pattern, click on the pattern icon or pick it from the drop down list depending on version.  

Alternatively, if you know the pattern name it can be entered in the OPTIONS dialogue box beside the word PATTERN.  

-----------------------
INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE
-----------------------
                       
For old hands: copy ACAD.PAT and ACAD.SLB into \SUPPORT.

For AutoCAD R14, 2000 and 2000i you may have to rename the file to acadiso.pat, see below.

For AutoCAD LT rename to acltiso.pat aclt.pat aclt.slb and replace current ones in \acadlt directory.  Depending on the version of LT, there may not be a "support" directory.  If there is, put the files there.

--------------
IN MORE DETAIL
--------------

To install this software it is neccessary to copy the files ACAD.PAT and
ACAD.SLB to your directory containing the ACAD.PAT hatch pattern file.
This file is contained in the AutoCAD \SUPPORT directory:

DOS version:      C:\ACAD\SUPPORT
WINDOWS version:  C:\ACADWIN\SUPPORT

If you are not sure which directory structure you have (or you wish to 
confirm the whereabouts of the ACAD.PAT file) then type the following
at the DOS prompt: DIR \ACAD.PAT/S   The display will show the directory
containing ACAD.PAT, for example:

DIRECTORY OF C:\ACADWIN\SUPPORT

Alternatively, use the "find files or folders" function in Windows, search for acad.pat

Once this has been established, it is usually a good idea to copy the original
ACAD.PAT and ACAD.SLB files to another directory for safe-keeping. 

Then, copy the new files to the SUPPORT directory, as follows:

DOS:
 
Enter the directory into which you downloaded these files.  Type this:

copy acad.pat,acad.slb \acadwin\support  (note the two spaces) or:

copy acad.pat,acad.slb \acad\support

The screen will display the message " files copied " this means that
you have succesfully loaded the software.

Note: ACAD.PAT and ACAD.SLB are not case sensitive, acad.pat and acad.slb
will do fine.

--------------
FOR AutoCAD LT
--------------

To install these patterns and slide library in AutoCAD LT the procedure is slightly different.

LT uses the names aclt.pat and (depending on version) acltiso.pat for the hatch pattern files.

The slide library in LT is called aclt.slb

Move the original files somewhere safe.

rename acad.pat to aclt.pat and copy it into the \acadlt directory, LT may not have the SUPPORT directory found in AutoCAD.

rename acad.slb to aclt.slb, copy this to \acadlt directory.

If you also have acltiso.pat then you must make another copy of your new acad.pat file and rename this to acltiso.pat (remember to move the original somewhere safe.)  Copy this also to \acadlt

If your version of LT has a support directory (2000 LTi does) copy the files there.

------------------
FOR R14 2000 2000i
------------------

For AutoCAD R14, 2000 and 2000i you will have to copy and rename the new file acad.pat to acadiso.pat which will leave you with two new files:

acad.pat
acadiso.pat

Both these files are identical except for the name.

Move the original versions of these somewhere safe, and place the new ones in the \support directory (folder.)

Move the original acad.slb file somewhere safe and replace this in the \support directory with your new acad.slb file.

---------------
PLEASE REMEMBER
---------------
           
When using a new pattern, it is usually better to err on the large side when
selecting scale.

If you cannot see the pattern, and you get an error message "no hatch created" then try a smaller scale.

As with all hatching operations, if you think something has gone wrong or
the pattern takes a very long time to appear, then you can terminate the
hatching operation by pressing CTRL C or Esc.

---------------------------
MAKE YOUR OWN SLIDE LIBRARY
---------------------------

To make your own slide library to display your own hatches you will need to use the MAKSLB utility.
