Below is a clean, structured, Antigravity-ready prompt you can paste verbatim into
Google Antigravity → Gemini Pro 3 (high).

It is explicitly planning / inventory / archaeology mode, with no execution, and it consolidates all Skalp-related locations and resources into a single authoritative analysis task.

⸻

Prompt for Google Antigravity — Gemini Pro 3 (high)

Operating Mode: Planning & Inventory Only

Hold on. We are back in planning mode.

You are NOT allowed to:
	•	execute code
	•	connect to servers
	•	modify repositories
	•	clean repositories
	•	rewrite history
	•	run database queries

This phase is pure analysis, inventory, documentation, and planning.

Server access and execution will only be revisited later, under a separate explicit execution mandate.

⸻

Role

You are acting as a senior software archaeologist and systems cartographer.

Your task is to:
	•	consolidate
	•	inventory
	•	contextualize
all known Skalp-related resources, regardless of age, cleanliness, or current relevance.

This is archaeology, not refactoring.

⸻

Primary Objective

Create a single authoritative document that consolidates all currently known Skalp-related locations, systems, repositories, and resources, including:
	•	what they are
	•	where they live
	•	what role they historically played
	•	what risks or uncertainties they contain
	•	what kind of analysis they will require later

This document must become the reference map for all future Skalp2026 work.

⸻

Known Skalp Resources (to be Consolidated)

You already have partial awareness of some of these.
You must now consolidate them all explicitly in one place.

⸻

1. Skalp_Legacy Repository
	•	Exists as:
	•	an Antigravity workspace
	•	a local working copy
	•	Remote to Bitbucket is broken
	•	Origin:
	•	Pulled from a shared Dropbox folder (owned by Guy)
	•	That Dropbox folder contains:
	•	Guy’s entire local workspace
	•	Potentially uncommitted or poorly committed artifacts
	•	Possibly files that never belonged in Git

This repo must be treated as:
	•	historically important
	•	potentially inconsistent
	•	a source of truth by behavior, not by cleanliness

⸻

2. Live Skalp Server (DigitalOcean Droplet)
	•	Live production server
	•	Running on DigitalOcean
	•	Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
	•	Access exists via SSH (credentials known, but do not connect now)

Key facts to document (without acting on them):
	•	Hosts:
	•	parts of the Skalp website
	•	PHP backend
	•	MySQL database
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	licensing
	•	update logic
	•	RBZ distribution
	•	gated downloads based on DB state

This server is:
	•	production
	•	stateful
	•	historically layered

⚠️ No actions allowed yet
This is inventory and understanding only.

⸻

3. License Server Codebase (skalp-license-server)
	•	Historically a git submodule of Skalp_Legacy
	•	Currently:
	•	heavily polluted
	•	contains RBZ builds
	•	likely contains other large binaries
	•	Hosted historically on Bitbucket
	•	A local copy exists (manually copied by Guy)

Future intention (not now, just documented):
	•	weed out binaries
	•	rewrite git history carefully
	•	reconstruct as a clean repository
	•	re-introduce as a submodule under Skalp2026
	•	move hosting to GitHub

For now:
	•	document state
	•	document risks
	•	document required future decisions

⸻

4. Skalp2026 Repository (Current Focus)
	•	Clean repository
	•	Hosted on GitHub
	•	Current Antigravity workspace points here
	•	Actively used by Guy
	•	Will be used by me later today
	•	Governed by previously prepared guidelines

This repo is:
	•	the future
	•	clean
	•	intentionally minimal
	•	dependent on correct archaeological understanding of the past

⸻

5. Large Local Historical Skalp Folder (Critical Archaeology)

Path:
/Users/jeroentheuns/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Skalp

Characteristics:
	•	Very large
	•	Contains:
	•	historic material
	•	experiments
	•	notes
	•	old builds
	•	forgotten ideas
	•	potentially critical clues
	•	True archaeology

Rules:
	•	READ-ONLY
	•	No tampering
	•	No reorganization
	•	No cleanup
	•	No assumptions

Goal:
	•	Analyze
	•	Classify
	•	Produce a contents-table-style overview
	•	Identify potentially critical artifacts

This folder must be archived mentally before it is touched physically.

⸻

6. Skalp Legacy Manual (User Perspective)
	•	Originally a large PDF
	•	Later replaced by hosted documentation:
https://www.manula.com/manuals/skalp

Status:
	•	Outdated
	•	Still valuable

Value:
	•	End-user mental model
	•	Licensing behavior from user perspective
	•	Intended workflows vs actual implementation

⸻

7. Video Tutorials (YouTube)

Playlist:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4o5Ke8mDBjjka1kZPJ5-tMhf_d51CVbr

Status:
	•	Outdated
	•	Still conceptually important

Value:
	•	Shows original intent
	•	Demonstrates workflows
	•	Reveals expectations encoded in server and licensing logic

⸻

8. Skalp Website

URL:
http://www.skalp4sketchup.com

Roles:
	•	Product presentation
	•	Marketing
	•	Point of sale

Critical aspect:
	•	Integration with FastSpring
	•	Licensing and purchasing flow

⸻

9. Reseller Infrastructure
	•	Historically active Skalp resellers
	•	Supported by:
	•	PHP-driven portal
	•	Hosted on the live server
	•	Backed by MySQL tables

Status:
	•	Possibly dormant
	•	Still structurally present
	•	Potentially impacts DB schema and logic

⸻

What You Must Produce Now

1. A Consolidated Inventory Document

This document must:
	•	List all resources above
	•	For each resource:
	•	location
	•	type (repo / server / docs / archive / media)
	•	role (past / present / future)
	•	risks
	•	unknowns
	•	recommended future analysis depth

2. A Classification Scheme

Propose:
	•	how these resources should be grouped
	•	which are:
	•	authoritative
	•	supporting
	•	archival
	•	operational
	•	hazardous (production)

3. A Readiness Map

Indicate:
	•	which resources are safe to analyze immediately
	•	which require safeguards
	•	which require explicit future consent before touching

⸻

Absolute Constraints
	•	No execution
	•	No server access
	•	No cleanup
	•	No refactoring
	•	No “obvious” assumptions

This phase is about knowing where we stand before we move.

⸻

Start now by:
	1.	Proposing the structure of the Consolidated Skalp Resource Inventory document
	2.	Listing all resources in a first-pass structured outline
	3.	Explicitly flagging the most archaeologically risky zones
